# WebProgramming_Final

For the final project in my web programming class, we were tasked with creating a flashcard website that would require used to create an account and login. Once the user is logged in, the will be able to make flashcards for one of the computer science languages. Users are able to change the color of flashcards, tag the flashcards, save cards, select cards to be deleted, and users can search through the flashcards for specific tags. 

This project was accomplished through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
