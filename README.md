# WebProgramming_Final

For the final project in my web programming class, we were tasked with creating a flashcard website that would require users to create an account and login. Once the user is logged in, they will be able to make flashcards for any of the given computer science topics. Users are able to change the color of flashcards, tag the flashcards, save cards, select cards to be deleted, and they can search through the flashcards for specific tags. 

This project was accomplished through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
